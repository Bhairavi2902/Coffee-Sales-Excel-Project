# Coffee-Sales-Excel-Project
Project Highlights:  
1. Data Gathering:
The data was scattered across multiple sheets. I used VLOOKUP and INDEX MATCH functions to consolidate and connect it effectively.
2. Data Cleaning:
Created new columns for Coffee Type Name and Roast Type Name using Nested IF formulas based on existing abbreviations
Standardized date formats for consistency
3. Data Visualization:
Built Pivot Tables to generate key insights
Designed visualizations including a Line Chart (Coffee Sales Over Time) and Bar Charts (Top 5 Customers, Sales by Country)
4. Slicers:
 Added interactive slicers to allow filtering by different product parameters

With this dashboard, a coffee shop owner can:  
Track sales trends over time  
Identify top customers and design targeted marketing campaigns
